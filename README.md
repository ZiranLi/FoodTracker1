# For hw2 part 2
#
my hw2 part 2 is an iOS application, however, I need to create an Apple developer account to generate .ipa file which will spend like 100$. So I get authorized from Zulin Liu https://github.com/liuzulin/EC601_HW2/tree/master/HW2_Unit_Test and using his android application.   

# Test by Amazon AWS test farm
